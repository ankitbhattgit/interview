create template for post for category


The Template Hierarchy specifies that WordPress will use the first Template file it finds in your current Theme's directory from the following list:

category-slug.php
category-ID.php
category.php
archive.php

That is, if you do not have a category-slug.php (lets say category-news.php), WordPress will check for a category-ID.php (like category-6.php), and so on.

So, if you want to make the Category whose ID number is 6 look different from what it is currently (and different from other Category pages), you would want to create a category-6.php file.
