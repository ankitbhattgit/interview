 Describe how PHP Works with Browser?
Works in following Flow
1. Open website http://www.web-technology-experts-notes.in/
2. Request send to server of http://www.web-technology-experts-notes.in/
3. Call PHP Files.
4. PHP Scripts are loaded into memory and compiled into Zend opcode.
5. These opcodes are executed and the HTML generated.
6. Same HTML is send back to Browser.


Question: What are important things about php functions?
PHP function start with "function function-name()".
PHP Function name must be start with character and it accept alphanumeric and _.
In build functions are case in-sensitive.
User build functions are case sensitive.
We can pass upto 64 parameter as argument.
Anonymous function are user defined function which have "no-name" and also called closures.


What does a special set of tags <?= and ?> do in PHP?
The output is displayed directly to the browser.


What’s the difference between include and require?
If the file is not found by require(), it will cause a fatal error and halt the execution of the script. If the file is not found by include(), a warning will be issued, but execution will continue.


require_once(), require(), include().What is difference between them?
require() includes and evaluates a specific file, while require_once() does that only if it has not been included before (on the same page). So, require_once() is recommended to use when you want to include a file where you have a lot of functions for example. This way you make sure you don't include the file more times and you will not get the "function re-declared" error.


I am trying to assign a variable the value of 0123, but it keeps coming up with a different number, what’s the problem?
PHP Interpreter treats numbers beginning with 0 as octal.


How do you define a constant?

Why doesn’t the following code print the newline properly?
<?php
$str = ‘Hello, there.nHow are you?nThanks for visiting Us’;
print $str;
?>
Because inside the single quotes the n character is not interpreted as newline, just as a sequence of two characters – and n.


Would you initialize your strings with single quotes or double quotes?
Since the data inside the single-quoted string is not parsed for variable substitution, it’s always a better idea speed-wise to initialize a string with single quotes, unless you specifically need variable substitution.


How come the code <?php print “Contents: $arr[1]“; ?> works, but <?php print “Contents: $arr[1][2]“; ?> doesn’t for two-dimensional array of mine?

1. In PHP, what are magic methods and how are they used?

PHP functions that start with a double underscore – a “__” – are called magic functions (and/or methods) in PHP. They are functions that are always defined inside classes, and are not stand-alone (outside of classes) functions. The magic functions available in PHP are: __construct(), __destruct(), __call(), __callStatic(), __get(), __set(), __isset(), __unset(), __sleep(), __wakeup(), __toString(), __invoke(), __set_state(), __clone(), and __autoload().



What’s the difference between an application server and a web server?

As the name implies, an application server hosts instances of a specific application, but provides a great deal of other functionality as well. This is because application servers provide building blocks (sometimes called components) that, when assembled, help create the application itself. An example of a component would be enterprise java beans, which are the main component used by J2EE application servers.

A Web server hosts web pages that can be seen in a Web browser. A Web server exclusively handles HTTP requests, and always responds using HTTP as well. This is in contrast to an application server, which can use protocols other than HTTP. In order to process a request for a web page, a Web server can do a number of things depending on the nature of the request: reply with a static HTML page, delegate the dynamic response generation to another appropriate program, such as server side scripts (like CGI), servlets, etc. The server-side technology varies, but the goal of such technologies is to generate a response, usually in HTML, to be viewed in a Web browser. When the Web server receives a request, it will pass the request to the server side program that it thinks is most suited to handle the request.






What are the differences between GET and POST methods in form submitting?
On the server side, the main difference between GET and POST is where the submitted is stored. The $_GET array stores data submitted by the GET method. The $_POST array stores data submitted by the POST method.
On the browser side, the difference is that data submitted by the GET method will be displayed in the browser’s address field. Data submitted by the POST method will not be displayed anywhere on the browser.
GET method is mostly used for submitting a small amount and less sensitive data.
POST method is mostly used for submitting a large amount or sensitive data.
We can send 1024 bytes using GET method but POST method can transfer large amount of data and POST is the secure method than GET method .




In HTML forms, what’s the difference between using the GET method versus POST?

 Think of HTTP as the language that your web browser uses to ‘speak’ with web servers. The type of HTTP request generated depends on the method used to submit the form (either a GET or a POST).

If a "GET" request is used, the form parameters are encoded in the URL in what is called a query string.

A POST request, unlike a GET request, passes the form parameters in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL. This happens behind the scenes, in what can be thought of as an HTTP ‘dialogue’ between your web browser and a webserver.

However, the main difference between GET and POST requests is that GET requests are meant to be (although not always are, because this depends on the programmer of the form) idempotent. What idempotent means is that one GET request for a particular URL, including the form parameters, is the same as 2 or more requests for that URL. This is because the response page is always the same. So, your web browser can usually cache the response pages for GET requests, because they should not change. POST requests, however, are not meant to be idempotent. This means that they cannot be cached, and the server is recontacted each time the page is displayed. POST requests are most suitable for queries where the response page will change over time – like a shopping cart.

 You could use a GET request to do pretty much the same thing as a POST query. It’s just that browsers are generally coded to expect that POST requests will be used for things that will cause changes – like placing an order, or writing to a database, etc . GET requests should be used for pure queries that don’t affect anything on the server. So, one should always remember not to use GET requests for any action that would cause a change on the server.Also for bookmarking purpose we will prefer get method.

Explain the different types of errors in PHP.
Notices, Warnings and Fatal errors are the types of errors in PHP

Notices:
Notices represents non-critical errors, i.e. accessing a variable that has not yet been defined. By default, such errors are not displayed to the user at all but whenever required, you can change this default behavior.
Warnings:
Warnings are more serious errors but they do not result in script termination. i.e calling include() a file which does not exist. By default, these errors are displayed to the user.
Fatal errors:
Fatal errors are critical errors i.e. calling a non-existent function or class. These errors cause the immediate termination of the script.




How to find current date and time?
The date() function provides you with a means of retrieving the current date and time, applying the format integer parameters indicated in your script to the timestamp provided or the current local time if no timestamp is given.

 Why we use session variable ?

Ans.  When we work on an application, we open it, do our stuff and then we close it. This is much like a (time interval)Session. The computer knows who we are. It knows when we started the application and when we ended it. But on the internet there is a problem,  web server does not know who we are and what we do. Because the HTTP address does not maintain state.
A PHP session solves this problem by allowing us to store user information on the server for later use (i.e. username, place,email id etc). However, session information is temporary and will be deleted as soon as the user has left the website. If we need a permanent storage then we have to store the data in a database.

) What does $_ENV means?

$_ENV is an associative array of variables sent to the current PHP script via the environment method.


What does $_COOKIE means?

$_COOKIE is an associative array of variables sent to the current PHP script using the HTTP Cookies.


0) What are the two main string operators?

The first is the concatenation operator (‘.’), which returns the concatenation of its right and left arguments. The second is (‘.=’), which appends the argument on the right to the argument on the left.

81) What does the array operator ‘===’ means?

$a === $b TRUE if $a and $b have the same key/value pairs in the same order and of the same types.



82) What is the differences between $a != $b and $a !== $b?

!= means inequality (TRUE if $a is not equal to $b) and !== means non-identity (TRUE if $a is not identical to $b).

How is it possible to parse a configuration file?

The function parse_ini_file() enables us to load in the ini file specified in filename, and returns the settings in it in an associative array.




9) What is the difference between the functions strstr() and stristr()?

The string function strstr(string allString, string occ) returns part of allString from the first occurrence of occ to the end of allString. This function is case-sensitive. stristr() is identical to strstr() except that it is case insensitive.



0) what is the difference between for and foreach?

for is expressed as follows:

for (expr1; expr2; expr3)

statement

The first expression is executed once at the beginning. In each iteration, expr2 is evaluated. If it is TRUE, the loop continues and the statements inside for are executed. If it evaluates to FALSE, the execution of the loop ends. expr3 is tested at the end of each iteration.

However, foreach provides an easy way to iterate over arrays and it is only used with arrays and objects.



) Is it possible to submit a form with a dedicated button?

It is possible to use the document.form.submit() function to submit the form. For example: <input type=button value=”SUBMIT” onClick=”document.form.submit()”>

?>



 3. What is difference between single quotes and double quotes in php.
 When string is in single quotes php will not evaluate it . If there is a string with single quotes and if we place a variable in that it would not substitute its value in string,  whereas double quotes support variable expansion. If we place variable in double quotes it would substitute its value in string.

 What is Object Oriented Programming?
 	Object Oriented Programming is a Style of programming that represents a program as a system of objects and enables code-reuse.Object orientation is a software/Web development methodology that is based on the modeling a real world system.An object is the core concept involved in the object orientation. An object is the copy of the real world enity.

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

Advantages of object oriented programming:

Code Re-usability(Polymorphism,Interfaces): In OOPs objects created in one program can be reused in different programs.
Code extensibility: for addding new features or modifying existing objects can be solved by introducing new objects.
Catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
Maintainability :objects can be maintained separately, so u can easily fix errors.
Imrove error handling:We can use exceptions to improve error handling.
Modularity: can create seperate Modules.
Modifiability:it is easy to make minor changes in some classes as Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program.


     What is Constructor?
A is special method of the class that will be automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created is called as constructor.

Constructors are mainly used to initialize private fields of the class while creating an instance for the class.

When you are not creating a constructor in the class, then compiler will automatically create a default constructor in the class that initializes all numeric fields in the class to zero and all string and object fields to null.

Syntax.
[Access Modifier] ClassName([Parameters])
{
}

9. Types of Constructors
Basically constructors are 5 types those are
Default Constructor
Parameterized Constructor
Copy Constructor
Static Constructor
Private Constructor


13. Different between method overriding and  method overloading?
In Overriding methods it will create two or more methods with same name and same parameter in different classes.

while Overloading it will create more then one method with same name but different parameter in same class.





 	 ) Explain about inheritance in OOPS?
Objects in one class can acquire properties of the objects in other classes by way of inheritance. Reusability which is a major factor is provided in object oriented programming which adds features to a class without modifying it. New class can be obtained from a class which is already present.


11) Explain about a class in OOP?
A class defines the characteristics of an object and its behaviors. This defines the nature and functioning of a specified object to which it is assigned.


 Explain the usage of encapsulation?
Encapsulation passes the message without revealing the exact functional details of the class. It allows only the relevant information to the user without revealing the functional mechanism through which a particular class had functioned..


13) Explain about abstraction?
It solves a complex problem by defining only those classes which are relevant to the problem and not involving the whole complex code into play.


Explain what is an object?
An object is a combination of messages and data. Objects can receive and send messages and use messages to interact with each other. The messages contain information that is to be passed to the recipient object.


 Explain about polymorphism?
Polymorphism helps a sub class to behave like a parent class. When an object belonging to different data types respond to methods which have a same name, the only condition being that those methods should perform different function.

It is simply "One thing, can use in different forms"
For example, One car (class) can extend two classes (hond & Alta)


       What are access control modifiers in php.
Keywords public,protected and private are the three types of access control modifiers in php.With  the help of these  keywords we can manage  the accessing  of a method or property of a class .


41. What is difference between public, private and protected in php.
Public :
The items which are declared public can be access from everywhere ie access from inside the class ,access in inherited class and   access from outside the class.

Protected :
The items which are declared protected can be access inside the class that defines the item  and can acess in its child classes  (ie access in its inherited class) .

Private :
The items which are declared private can only be access inside its class that defines the item.


What is an Abstract class ?
Answers : 6
Abstract class defines an abstract concept which can not be instantiated and comparing o interface it can have some implementation while interfaces can not. Below are some
points for abstract class:-
=>We can not create object of abstract class it can only be inherited in a below class.
=> Normally abstract classes have base implementation and then child classes derive from the abstract class to make the class concrete.


What are Abstract methods?
Answers : 7
Abstract class can contain abstract methods. Abstract methods do not have implementation. Abstract methods should be implemented in the subclasses which inherit them.


What is the difference between Abstract classes and Interfaces ?
Answers :
Difference between Abstract class and Interface is as follows:-
Abstract class can only be inherited while interfaces can not be it has to be implemented.
Interface cannot implement any methods, whereas an abstract class can have implementation.
An interface is a collection of abstract method. If the class implements an inheritance, and then thereby inherits all the abstract methods of an interface.
Class can implement many interfaces but can have only one super class.
Interface is not part of the class hierarchy while Abstract class comes in through inheritance.
Unrelated classes can implement the same interface.
 All methods in interfaces must be public



12. What is final class.
final class is a class that can not be inherited.Its protect the methods of class to be overriden by the child classes.


	What is difference between Static and Non-Static fields of a class ?
Answers : 9
Non-Static values are also called as instance variables. Each object of the class has its own copy of Non-Static instance variables. So when a new object is created of the same class it will have completely its own copy of instance variables. While Static values have only one copy of instance variables and will be shared among all the objects of the class.



11	What is a constructor in class?
Answers : 11
Constructor is a method used to initialize the state of an object, and it gets invoked at the time of object creation. Rules forconstructor are:.
Constructor Name should be same asclass name.
Constructor must have no return type.



Define exceptions ?
Answers : 17
An exception is an abnormal condition that arises in a code sequence at run time. Basically there are four important keywords which form the main pillars of exception handling: try, catch, throw and finally. Code which you want to monitor for exception is contained in the try block.


. Define Destructor?
Destructor is a method which is automatically called when the object ismade ofscope or destroyed. Destructor name is also same asclass name but with the tilde symbol before the name.


4. What is function overloading?
Function overloading is defined as a normal function, but it has the ability to perform different tasks. It allowscreation of several methods with the same name which differ from each other by type of input and output of the function.

Example:
void add(int& a, int& b);
void add(double& a, double& b);
void add(struct bob& a, struct bob& b);


34. What is ‘this’ pointer?
THIS pointer refers to the current object of a class. THIS keyword is used as a pointer which differentiates between the current object with the global object. Basically, it refers to the current object.


. What is the difference between structure and a class?
Structure default access type is public , but class access type is private. A structure is used for grouping data whereas class can be used for grouping data and methods.
Structures are exclusively used for dataand it doesn’t require strict validation , but classes are used to encapsulates and inherit data which requires strict validation.


What is the default access modifier in a class?
The default access modifier of a class is Private by default.


. What are all the operators that cannot be overloaded?
Following are the operators that cannot be overloaded -.
Scope Resolution (:: )
Member Selection (.)


static class

A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new keyword to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. For example, if you have a static class that is named UtilityClass that has a public method named MethodA, you call the method as shown in the following example:


UtilityClass.MethodA();


What’s the difference between accessing a class method via -> and via ::?
:: is allowed to access methods that can perform static operations, i.e. those, which do not require object initialization.


How do you call a constructor for a parent class?
parent::__construct();


What's the purpose of using a private constructor?

It ensures that there can be only one instance of a Class and provides a global access point to that instance and this is common with The Singleton Pattern.

The singleton pattern

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions;
Objects are instances of classes, are used to interact with one another.


What is difference between class and interface?
1) Interfaces do not contain business logic
2)You must extend interface to use.
3) You can't create object of interface.


How to load classes in PHP.
We can load a class with the use of "autoload" class.

Are Parent constructors called implicitly when create an object of class?
No, Parent constructors are not called implicitly It must call this explicitly. But If Child constructors is missing then parent constructor called implicitly.


What are different visibility of method/property?
There are 3 types of visibility of method & property and are following
Public: Can be accessed from same class method, child class and from outside of class.
Protected : Can be accessed from same class method, child class.
Private: Can be accessed from same class method only.

What is Scope Resolution Operator?
The Scope Resolution Operator (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim) is double colon that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

OOP Interview Questions And Answers
OOP Interview Questions and Answers


What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions;
Objects are instances of classes, are used to interact with one another.

Following are few examples of object-oriented programming languages
PHP, C++, Objective-C, Smalltalk, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby.

The goals of object-oriented programming are:
Increased understanding.
Ease of maintenance.
Ease of evolution.


What is data modeling?
In class, we create multiple get/set function to get and set the data through the protected functions known as Data Modeling.
class dataModel {
    public function __set( $key, $value ) {
        $this->$key = $value;
    }
}
Following are the benefits of Data Modeling
It is very fast.
Smart way to  manipulation on data
No extra layer of logic
Really flexible to be modeled per need
Setters can explicitly define what data can be loaded into the object


What is difference between class and interface?
1) Interfaces do not contain business logic
2)You must extend interface to use.
3) You can't create object of interface.



How Session - cookie works in PHP?
When a website open in new client machine(Browser), new sessionId is created and stored in php server and in client machine (In cookie).
All data is store in PHP Server and cookie only have sessionId. When client send sessionId with request to the server, then server fetch the data corresponsing to that sessionId and retun to the browser.



What are some of the big changes PHP has gone through in the past few years?
5.1 added PDO
5.3 - added namespace support



What is Polymorphism?
It is simply "One thing, can use in different forms"
For example, One car (class) can extend two classes (hond & Alta)



How to load classes in PHP.
We can load a class with the use of "autoload" class.
If we want to change from default function autoload to testautload function.
we can do this with "spl_autoload_register"
spl_autoload_register('kumar');



How to call parent constructor?
parent::__construct()



Are Parent constructors called implicitly when create an object of class?
No, Parent constructors are not called implicitly It must call this explicitly. But If Child constructors is missing then parent constructor called implicitly.



What happen, If constructor is defined as private OR protected.
If constructor declared as private, PHP through the following fatal error when create object. Fatal error: Call to private BaseClass::__construct() from invalid context in. If constructor declared as private, PHP through the following fatal error when create object. Fatal error: Call to protected BaseClass::__construct() from invalid context in



What happen, If New-Style constructor & old-style constructor are defined. Which one will be called.
New-Style constructor will called. But if New-Style constructor is missing, old style constructor will called.


What are different visibility of method/property?
There are 3 types of visibility of method & property and are following
Public: Can be accessed from same class method, child class and from outside of class.
Protected : Can be accessed from same class method, child class.
Private: Can be accessed from same class method only.
class TestClass
{
    public $public = 'Public';
    protected $protected = 'Protected';
    private $private = 'Private';

    function printValue()
    {
        echo $this->public;
        echo $this->protected;
        echo $this->private;
    }
}

$obj = new TestClass();
echo $obj->public; // Works
echo $obj->protected; // Fatal error: Cannot access protected property TestClass::$protected in
echo $obj->private; // Fatal error: Cannot access private property TestClass::$private in C:\wamp\www\arun\class\class.php on line 20
$obj->printValue(); // Shows Public, Protected and Private


What is Scope Resolution Operator?
The Scope Resolution Operator (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim) is double colon that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class. Following are different uses Access to static
Acess the constant
Access the overridden properties of parent class
Access the overridden methods of a parent class



What is Static Keyword in PHP?
If we declare a Method or Class Property as static, then we can access that without use of instantiation of the class.
Static Method are faster than Normal method.
$this is not available within Static Method.
Static properties cannot be accessed through the object(i.e arrow operator)



What is Abstraction in PHP?
Abstraction are defined using the keyword abstract . Classes defined as abstract may not be instantiated (create object).
To extend the Abstract class, extends operator is used.You can inherit only one abstract class at one time extending.
Any class that contains one abstract method must also be declare as abstract. Methods defined as abstract simply declare the method's signature, they can't define the implementation.All methods marked as abstract in the parent's class, declaration must be defined by the child.additionally, these methods must be defined with the same (or a less restricted) visibility (Public,Protected & private).


What is Interface in PHP?
Interfaces are defined using the interface keyword.All methods declared in an interface must be public. Classes defined as Interface may not be instantiated(create object).To extend the interface class, implements operator is used.
You can inherit number of interface class at the time of extending and number of abstract class separated by comma.
All methods in the interface must be implemented within a child class; failure to do so will result in a fatal error.
Interfaces can be extended like classes using the extends operator.The class implementing the interface must use the exact same method signatures as are defined in the interface.

What is Traits in PHP?
Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance.


What is Serialize function in php?
It return string containing a byte-stream representation of any value that can be stored in PHP.

What is Polymorphism?
likelihood medium
Don't get scared by the big word. It's simply the idea that one object can can take on many forms. So in PHP OOP one class "cars" may have two classes that extend it, for example a "Honda" class and a "BMW" class.

multi-threading

Multi-threading allows you to use up your machine’s resources intelligently. Instead of running everything in the same old top-to-bottom continuous execution, you can run tasks in parallel. What you are looking for is pthreads - The API that allows you to implement most sorts of multi-threading in your PHP code. It includes all the tools you need to create multi-threaded applications targeted at the Web or the Console. PHP applications can create, read, write, execute and synchronize with Threads, Workers and Stackables.
