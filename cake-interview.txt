Cakephp is a rapid development framework for PHP that provides an extensible architecture for developing, maintaining, and deploying applications. it uses commonly known design patterns like MVC,ORM within the convention over configuration paradigm, It also reduces development costs and helps developers write less code.

why cakephp, and why not any other framework.
Me : it has been for years in the market with strong support in the form of communities and online documentation, it supports php 4/5 , sometimes it becomes mandatory to support php4 because of client's limitation in support php5, there cakephp helps.

Model      : Database functions exist in the model
View        : Design parts written here
Controller : Business Logic goes here

The advantage with the second approach $this->set(compact()); is easier to write, and useful especially when we are setting several variables to the view.No need to add separate line for each variable as we have with $this->set();

$this->set(compact('posts','users','reports'));
